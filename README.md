# Value-at-Risk-VaR-Modeling-in-Excel
This Excel project implements a comprehensive Value at Risk (VaR) framework to estimate potential portfolio losses of **Top 3 Indian Banks** (**as per market capitalization as on 22 May 2025**) through multiple methodologies:

## Methodologies Implemented: 
Engineered an advanced VaR framework in Excel to quantify portfolio risk by implementing three core approaches:

- **Variance-Covariance Method**  
 Utilized covariance matrix and parametric assumptions to estimate VaR analytically.

- **Historical Simulation**  
 Applied empirical distribution of historical returns to simulate potential portfolio losses without distributional assumptions.

- **Monte Carlo Simulation**  
 Ran 1,000 stochastic simulations generating a wide range of portfolio return scenarios based on random sampling from specified distributions.

## Backtesting and Validation
To ensure model robustness and regulatory compliance, I conducted rigorous backtesting using:

- **Traffic Light Approach**  
  A visual diagnostic tool classifying VaR breaches into green, yellow, or red zones to assess model accuracy over time.
  
- **Kupiec Proportion of Failures (POF) Test**  
  A statistical hypothesis test evaluating the consistency between observed VaR breaches and expected failure rates.

## Features
- End-to-end risk modeling and quantification  
- Scenario analysis with simulated return distributions  
- Robust backtesting framework ensuring model reliability  
- Fully automated Excel workbook for practical financial risk management  

## Usage
- Load your portfolio returns data  
- Select VaR method and confidence level  
- Run simulations and view VaR estimates  
- Perform backtesting to validate risk metrics

# Conclusion:
The project deepened insights into portfolio tail risks, enhanced risk quantification accuracy, and demonstrated proficiency in risk analytics using Excel as a flexible modeling environment.
