# Value-at-Risk-VaR-Modeling-in-Excel
This Excel project implements a comprehensive Value at Risk (VaR) framework to estimate potential portfolio losses of top 3 indian banks (as per market capitalization as on 22 May 2025) through multiple methodologies:

## Methodologies Implemented

- **Variance-Covariance Method**  
  Analytical VaR calculation using portfolio mean, variance, and covariance matrix.

- **Historical Simulation**  
  Non-parametric simulation leveraging historical returns to model portfolio risk without distribution assumptions.

- **Monte Carlo Simulation**  
  Stochastic simulation with 1,000+ iterations generating a broad distribution of possible portfolio returns.

## Backtesting and Validation

- **Traffic Light Approach**  
  Visual diagnostic tool to monitor VaR breaches classified into green, yellow, and red zones.

- **Kupiec Proportion of Failures (POF) Test**  
  Statistical test to evaluate the consistency between observed and expected VaR exceptions.

## Features

- End-to-end risk modeling and quantification  
- Scenario analysis with simulated return distributions  
- Robust backtesting framework ensuring model reliability  
- Fully automated Excel workbook for practical financial risk management  

## Usage

- Load your portfolio returns data  
- Select VaR method and confidence level  
- Run simulations and view VaR estimates  
- Perform backtesting to validate risk metrics
